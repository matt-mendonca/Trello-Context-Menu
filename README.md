###I am not affiliated with Trello or Fog Creek Software

This is some proof of concept JS code to bind secondary click to menus in Trello. 

Right click on a list to bring up the list menu, right click on a card to bring up the card menu

####Try it out
Paste the contents of trello.contextmenu.js into the javascript console of your browser window (or tab) that has Trello opened
